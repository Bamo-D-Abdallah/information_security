    <summary>Polyalphabetic ciphers</summary>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the substitution may change throughout the message.
</details>

<details>
    <summary>Polygraphic ciphers</summary>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; instead of substituting one letter for another letter it performs substitutions with two or more groups of letters.
</details>

<details>
    <summary>Playfair cipher</summary>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is a best known as multiple-letter cipher based on the use of 5x5 matrix of letters using a keyword.
</details>

<details>
    <summary>Transport cipher</summary>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a block cipher which acts on the plaintext by permuting the positions of the characters in the plaintext
</details>


<details>
    <summary>Rail Fence cipher</summary>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the plaintext is written downwards and diagonally on successive "rails" of an imaginary fence.
</details>

    <summary>The two ways that ciphers may be secure</summary>
    <ol>
        <li>computational security</li>
        <li>unconditional security</li>
    </ol>
</details>


<details>
    <summary>computational security</summary>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; given limited computing resources, the cipher cannot be broken.
</details>

<details>
    <summary>unconditional security</summary>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; no matter how much computer power is available, the cipher cannot be broken.
</details>

<details>
    <summary>Ciphertext-only attack</summary>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the situation where the attacker doesn ot know anything about the contents of the message.
</details>

<details>
    <summary>Known-plaintext attack</summary>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the attacker knows or can guess the plaintext for some parts of the Ciphertext. the task is to decrypt the rest of the ciphertext blocks using this information.
</details>

<details>
    <summary>Chosen-plaintext attack</summary>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the attacker is able to have any text he likes encrypted with the unknown key. The task is to determine the key used for encryption.
</details>

<details>
    <summary>Man-in-middle attack</summary>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; two parties are exchanging keys for secure communication, an adversary puts himself between the prties on the communication line.
</details>

<details>
    <summary>Frequency analysis</summary>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the study of the frequency of letters or groups of letters in a ciphertext.
</details>

<details>
    <summary>counting letters</summary>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the study of the frequency of letters or groups of letters in a ciphertext.
</details>


<details>
    <summary>Block Cipher</summary>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is an encryption/decryption scheme in which a block of plaintext is used to produce a cipher text block of equal length.
</details>
