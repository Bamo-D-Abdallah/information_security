    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the state of being free from danger or threat
</details>

<details>
    <summary>Information Security</summary>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; method of protecting digital information from unauthroized access.
</details>


<details>
    <summary>What are the three Information  security principles?</summary>
    <ul>
        <li>Confidentiality</li>

    </ul>
</details>

<details>
    <summary>Confidentiality</summary>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; information is only being seen or used by people who are authorized to access it.
</details>

<details>
    <summary>Integrity</summary>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; any change to the information by an unauthorized user is impossible and change by authorized user is tracked.
</details>

<details>
    <summary>Availability</summary>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the information is accessible when authorized users need it.
</details>

<details>
    <summary>Threat</summary>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; possible danger that might exploit vulnerability
</details>

<details>
    <summary>Attacks</summary>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a deliberate attempt to violate the security policy of the system.
</details>

<details>
    <summary>Security attack</summary>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; any action that compromises the security of information owned by the organization
</details>

<details>
    <summary>Passive attack</summary>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; monitoring of transmission.
</details>

<details>
    <summary>Types of attacks</summary>
    <ul>
        <li>Passive attack</li>
        <li>Active attack</li>
    </ul>
</details>

<details>
    <summary>Passive attack</summary>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; monitoring of transmission
</details>

<details>
    <summary>Active attack</summary>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; involves modification or false data stream creation.
</details>


<details>
    <summary>Types of Passive attack</summary>
    <ul>
        <li> Release of message content </li>

    </ul>
</details>

<details>
    <summary>Types of Active attack</summary>
    <ul>

    </ul>
</details>

<details>
    <summary>Why it is difficult to detect?</summary>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Because the sender and receiver can't detect third parties reading their messages.
</details>

<details>
    <summary>Masquerade</summary>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; takes place when an entity pretends to be different entity.
</details>

<details>
    <summary>Modification of message</summary>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; means that some portion of genuine message is altered or that message is delayed or reordered to produce an unautohrized effect.
</details>

<details>
    <summary>Replay</summary>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; involves the passive capture of a data unit and its subsequent transimission to produce an unauthorized effect.
</details>

<details>
    <summary>Denial of Service (DOS)</summary>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; prevents a normal use of management of communication facilities.
</details>


<details>
    <summary>Denial of Service</summary>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; prevents a normal use of management of communication facilities.
</details>

<details>
    <summary>Authentication</summary>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is an assurance that the communication entity is the one that claims to be.
</details>

<details>
    <summary>Types of authentication</summary>
    <ul>
        <li>Peer Entity authentication</li>
        <li>Data-Origin authentication</li>
    </ul>
</details>

<details>
    <summary>Peer Entity authentication</summary>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Peer entity authentication is the process of verifying the identity of entities involved in a logical connection to ensure their legitimacy.
</details>

<details>
    <summary>Data-Origin authentication</summary>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in a connectionless transfer, provides assurance that the source of received data is as claimed.
</details>

<details>
    <summary>Data Confidentiality</summary>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is the protection of data from unauthorized leak
</details>

<details>
    <summary>Access Control</summary>

</details>

<details>
    <summary>Data Integrity</summary>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is the assurance that the data received are exactly as sent by an authorized entity.
</details>

<details>
    <summary>Nonrepudiation</summary>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; provides protection against denial of any one of the entities participating in a communication.
</details>

<details>
    <summary>Types of nonrepudiation</summary>
    <ul>
        <li>Origin</li>
        <li>Destination</li>
    <ul>

<details>
    <summary>Destination Nonrepudiation</summary>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; proof that the message was received by the specified party.
</details>

<details>

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Observing the pattern of messages
</details>


<details>
    <summary>Why it is difficult to detect passive attack?</summary>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Because the sender and receiver can't detect third parties reading their messages.
</details>

<details>
    <summary>How do you prevent passive attack?</summary>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By using encryption
</details>

<details>
    <summary>Why it is difficult to prevent active attack?</summary>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; because of the wide variety of potential physical, software and network vulnerabilities.
</details>

<details>
    <summary>What is the goal against passive attack?</summary>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; prevention rather than detection.
</details>

<details>
    <summary>What is the goal against active attack?</summary>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to detect them and recover from any disruption or delay.
</details>

<details>
    <summary>What does "Access Control" control?</summary>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; who can access to a resource, what they allowed to do, and under what condition they can access it.
</details>

<details>
    <summary>What does Data Integrity doesn't allow?</summary>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; it will not allow any modification, insertion or deletion to a resource.
